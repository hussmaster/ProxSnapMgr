# Proxmox Snapshot Manager

Mostly writing this to get comfy with Python. This will utilize the python package **proxmoxer**. This is a community maintained package but it is on the official API Proxmox wiki.

I'd like to utilize this package to create an interface to be able to select X number of VMs or LXCs and snapshot them all with the same name. And then have the ability to remove X number of those snapshots. Could be all, could just be one.
